```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  val y = x + 1 //Side effect dependent on x
  def this() = this(0) // Auxiliary constructor
}

class MyClassFixed(val x: Int) {
  val y = x + 1 //Side effect dependent on x
  def this() { // Auxiliary constructor
    this(0)
  }
}
```
In this updated code (`MyClassFixed`), the auxiliary constructor explicitly calls the primary constructor, ensuring that all initialization logic is executed regardless of how the object is created. This avoids potential issues stemming from omitted side effects.
